# Memory Game Project

https://nurbaki.github.io/12-Memory-Game-project/

I developed this project using JavaScript.
Since game projects require setting up algorithms, they are the projects I like to do and deal with.

I made the general view of the project with the help of Bootstrap. Although it is not visually professional, I managed to produce a real Memory Game.

Of course, my main goal was to improve my JavaScript skills. This project has been very useful in this regard.

Thank you.
